    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Green smoothies are all the rage in health-conscious circles. This green smoothie is no different, apart from one important fact.</p>
    <p>What's the difference, you ask?</p>
    <p>This green smoothie is, in fact, nothing like the image shown. This green smoothie does not taste good. The texture leaves much to be desired. And the color isn't quite as appealing.</p>
    <p>But if you're trying to get your daily greens and five servings of veggies, you'll love the ease of this simple, yet digestively effective, recipe.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>whole, peeled navel orange</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add produce to blender.</li>
        <li>Add in ice to your liking, more for a thicker smoothie and less for an easier to chug consistency.</li>
        <li>Pour the liquid of your choosing until it covers the produce.</li>
        <li>Blend until smooth, adding more liquid or ice as preferred.</li>
        <li>Pour into a glass.</li>
